# 🧠 Jarvis Notch — Your Developer Sidekick for GitHub Repos

> A futuristic macOS app with a dynamic, notch-style interface that feels like Jarvis from Iron Man. This AI-powered assistant helps developers understand codebases, answer questions live, and visualize repositories — all with voice or text.

## 🚀 Features

* 🎙️ **Voice & Text Interface**

  * Mic input with real-time STT (speech-to-text)
  * Notch-style overlay UI with listening and typing modes
  * Word-by-word animated responses from the AI agent

* 🔍 **Live Q\&A over GitHub Repos**

  * Ask questions about your codebase in natural language
  * Accurate, up-to-date answers using AI with live web search
  * Summary, Q\&A, and visual flow of repo logic

* 🧰 **GitHub Repo Tools**

  * Add/remove/list connected repositories
  * File-level summarization
  * Generate visual flow diagrams to understand structure

* 🧠 **Agent Intelligence**

  * STT + TTS integrated AI agent
  * Real-time conversation and memory via Redis
  * RAG-enabled PDF chat and code documentation features (coming soon)

* 💬 **Smart UI/UX**

  * Transparent notch overlay (like NotchNook)
  * Auto-hide and reappear near camera area on hover
  * Animated mic + status display for intuitive feedback

## 🛠 Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/jarvis-notch.git
cd jarvis-notch
```

### 2. Backend (Python + Flask)

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

### 3. Frontend (SwiftUI macOS app)

* Open `JarvisNotch.xcodeproj` in Xcode
* Build & run on macOS
* Make sure mic permissions are granted

### 4. Env Setup

Create a `.env` file for both frontend and backend:

```bash
# .env (backend)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key
GOOGLE_CLOUD_CREDENTIALS=...
GITHUB_TOKEN=...
REDIS_URL=...
```

## 🧪 Usage

* Hover near the camera notch to activate the overlay
* Speak or type a question
* Ask about connected GitHub repos, code summaries, or "What does X file do?"
* Add/remove repos from the GitHub page
* Watch real-time responses animate inside the notch

## 📦 Roadmap

* [x] Real-time STT with auto-restart
* [x] GitHub repo tools with file summaries
* [x] Live web + repo Q\&A
* [x] SingleCommand local projectSetup + githubRepoSetup 
* [ ] Mermaid diagram for repos
* [ ] PDF-based RAG learning
* [ ] Multi-agent coordination
* [ ] Custom voice skins + UI themes
* [ ] wakeWord
* [ ] voiceCloning
* [ ] Enhance the UI
